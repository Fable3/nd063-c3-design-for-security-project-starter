# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

Sadly, GuardDuty didn't find anything after half an hour. I've attached one of the VPC Flow logs, 3.81.145.168 is the attacker IP address. The Udacity Knowledge page suggested to just carry on.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
