# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

I've used Regula which was already set up for the previous excercises with Terraform. It also handles CloudFormation.

### Example vulnerability
using it on the original c3-app.yml:
FG_R00085: VPC security group rules should not permit ingress from '0.0.0.0/0' to TCP/UDP port 22 (SSH) [High]

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

One possible tool to scan for OS vulnerabilities would be 'puppet'. This is a bit harder to set up than Regula.

### Example vulnerability

The previous issue with allowing password-based login for SSH would be one example of OS vulnerability.

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

The AWS Config did a good job for showing non-compliant rules.

### Example vulnerability

For example it shows S3 buckets that fail the check for S3 encryption: "securityhub-s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled-bad5d44b"
Here, in the "Resources in scope" the 2 buckets were listed before adding default ecryption.
